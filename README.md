# Overview
These are (a majority of) my lecture notes for CS394R from Summer 2021 meant as a supplement for future students. I got into a time crunch towards the end and wasn't able to put the time into actually getting the last few lectures typed out, so if you'd be able to contribute I'm sure future students would appreciate it!

# Contributing
I used [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for everything here. If you'd like to contribute, just branch off and throw a PR and I'll merge when I can!

# Errors
If you come across any errors or typos, feel free to either fix them and open a pull request or let me know and I'll be happy to fix them myself. These are my personal notes first and foremost so there may be small oversights here and there.
